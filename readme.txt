Internshala Haxx lmao
Basic python3 script which uses online fake mail vendors to create accounts and refferals. Helped me unlock Vip access for Grand Summer Internship Festival on internshala.com .
YMMV

Also,
haxx.py is an unfinished script which was targeted to exploit account creation using telegram's @fakemailbot, but it turned out that internshala has banned their domain.
haxx2.py is the working script which is a selenium script to browse and create accounts.
Change internshala_link inside haxx2 with your referral link.

Dependencies-
selenium
names
passwordgenerator
